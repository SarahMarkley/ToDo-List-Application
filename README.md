Title: ToDo List Application

Description: The ToDo list application is used as a daily tracker, or ToDo list, where items can be checked off as they are completed. 

How to Run: In order to run the ToDo list application, download the homePage.jpg file and the ToDo List and Rendering List folders into the same directory. Open index.html in your preferred browser and see the ToDo list appear. In this list, you can remove items once they are completed by clicking the (-) sign. You can also add additional items that you would like to add onto your ToDo list, as well.

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future, it would be helpful to add additional ToDo list components and a way to review each item that was checked off.
